NAME
	HypericChecker - resource checker for Hyperic resources

SYNOPSIS
	HypericChecker.sh [-d] [-h] [-p defaults-file] [-s AEID] [-r RID]

DESCRIPTION
	HypericChecker is a java wrapper for Hyperic measurement plugins specifically intended to perform on-demand checks of netservices plugin resources. The wrapper uses several classes and methods from Hyperic to call the actual code that the Hyperic agent uses to collect metrics on a resource in a consistent and reproducable manner. Multiple AEID's and RID's can be specified on the command line to check multiple resources with one invokation. Binary packages can be downloaded at http://hyperic.allrightname.com/HypericCheck-latest.tar.bz2

OPTIONS
	-d	Enable DEBUG logging

	-h	This help message

	-p	defaults-file
		Use an alternate properties file as the configuration source. Defaults to ~/.hq/client.properties

	-s	AEID
		Specify a resource to collect metrics on via AEID. AEID's can be found as the last 5 digits on a resource's URL within the Hyperic GUI

	-r	RID
		Specify a resource to collect metrics on via RID. RID's can be found using the hqapi.

FILES
	~/.hq/client.properties
		The default configuration file. Expects the file to conform to Java's syntax for properties files and takes values in the <key>=<value> form.
		Sample config:

			host=monitor.mynetwork.com
			port=7443
			secure=true
			user=hqadmin
			password=hqadmin

		Aside from the default options for hqapi in the client.properties file, the following HypericCheck specific options are expected:

			hc.pdkDir	Full path to the lib/pdk directory that came with this utility
			hc.pluginDir	Full path to the lib/plugins directory that came with this utility

		The following options are optional and apply to the usage of the PasswordBouncer utility so that no passwords need to be on your filesystem. If you use these options, the password key need not have a value.

			hc.password.source	Only accepts \"pb\".
			hc.password.port	Port that PasswordBouncer is listening on. Defaults to 10127.
			hc.password.host	Address that PasswordBouncer is listening on. Defaults to localhost.
			hc.password.string	String that PasswordBouncer expects prior to returning a password. Defaults to MYPASSWORD.

			hc.metricsetSet this to "all", "availability", "throughput", or "utilization" to see metrics of a different category.
